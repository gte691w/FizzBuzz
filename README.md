In a FizzBuzz app  you enter a number from  1 to a given number (let’s say 100). 
For each number if it’s not divisible by 3 or 5, the program returns that number. 
If it’s divisible by 3, instead of the number you the program retruns “Fizz”. If it’s divisible by 5, 
it returns “Buzz”. And finally if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, you get “Fizz-Buzz”.
